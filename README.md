This repository simply holds the sheets I sometimes need to write down when trying to learn a song a like from e.g. a youtube video. The sheets should have a reference to the youtube video I derived it from.

In case you have corrections or improvements and would be willing to share them, don't hesitate to contact me.


In case you are the one who published the original video and do not want me to publish the sheets, feel free to contact me and I will remove them from this repository.

You can contact me either by opening an issue here on github or if you do not have an account you can reach me via email through soja-accordion@aries.uberspace.de
